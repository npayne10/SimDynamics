# SimDynamics
This is for the documents and code for the SimDynamics 3DOF Actuator Simulator and related software.

## Wiring
- `docs/wiring-diagram.pdf` shows the Arduino Mega 2560 wiring to four HBS86H drivers and their limit switches.
- Regenerate the PDF by running `python docs/wiring_diagram.py`; the script writes PDF primitives directly so it has no external dependencies.
